title: 'How did Country Sundries come about?'

## Brief history

This section will be particularly more personal as I will give a brief explanation of how Countries Sundries came to be.

In the planning process of another project (still in development), I had the emergency of having to show the banner icons of all possible countries in a selector, this led me to decide if I would save those icons locally or I would bring them from an API.

After searching, at that moment I realized that there was no other API that would return the information I wanted, which is why I decided to take the initiative to start the development of what is now Country Sundries.
An API that would have the initial objective of obtaining the image of the flag of the countries, a very simple project, but that over time I expanded and there are still plans to continue expanding.

I took advantage of this opportunity that was presented to me to develop this API, not only for myself; but for everyone who has been involved in the same situation as mine.

Additionally, I'm excited to say that the Countries Sundries API was developed with technologies that were totally new to me; both those used for the development of the API structure itself, as well as those used for documentation, Database and other information security aspects.

This is how the planning and development of what is today Countries Sundries API began.
