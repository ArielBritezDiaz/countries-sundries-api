In this section we will show you the endpoint for 'country', his parameters, combinations and specific details

## Endpoints response and parameters

This endpoint will return the information of the countries with limit of 50 countries.

## `/country/all`
The `/country/all` endpoint, if no limit is specified, will by default return 50 countries from the database.

### Example Request
>We will make an example of a possible API request that could be given in case you want to bring all possible countries.\
In this example, we are creating an asynchronous arrow function that will search for the [**Country Sundries**](http://countries-sundries-api.com/) URL with the endpoint `country/all`.\
We will use an arrow function that will fetch the URL of **Countries Sundries** with the endpoint `country/all`, using the **'GET'** method and with the headers established, which will be `x-countries_sundries_api-key`, `x-api -version`, and we will include an optional header that will be `Content-Type` to bring the data in JSON format.\
We will save the result in a constant and return it, this result will be saved in a constant called **'fetchApiExample'** and then call it.

:::note[Keep in mind...]
  The fewer country records you bring in, the faster the server will respond
