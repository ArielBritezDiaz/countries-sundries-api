In this section we will show you the **`region`** endpoint, its parameters, combinations and specific details.\
As you can imagine, the information of this endpoint is six registers, which is why this section will be brief ðŸ˜…

## Endpoint response and parameters

The endpoint `region` will return the information of the six regions of the world.

## `region/all`
The `region/all` endpoint, if no limit is specified, will by default return the six regions of the world from the database.

### Example Request

>We will make an example of a possible API request that could be given in case you want to bring all possible flags images.\
In this example, we are creating an asynchronous arrow function that will search for the [**Country Sundries**](http://countries-sundries-api.com/) URL with the endpoint `region/all`.\
We will use an arrow function that will fetch the URL of **Countries Sundries** with the endpoint `region/all`, using the **'GET'** method and with the headers established, which will be `x-countries_sundries_api-key`, `x-api-version`, and we will include an optional header that will be `Content-Type` to bring the data in JSON format.\
We will save the result in a constant and return it, this result will be saved in a constant called **'fetchApiExample'** and then call it.

<CodeExampleRegionAll />

### Response
>The result of the request will be a JSON object with the information of the six regions of the world.

### Header Parameters
:::note[Remember!]
See the [Global Header Parameters](/docs/api-reference/global-header-parameters) section so you can make these requests correctly and with the necessary permissions.

### Query Parameters
In the Query Parameters sections we will use the [CURL](https://curl.se/) command to show how to use parameters in the request. These query parameter tests will also be possible in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or other API testing tools, for example.\

#### `id`
> _Optional Integer_\
Allows you to filter records by id
```bash
curl -X GET 'http://countries-sundries-api.com/region/all?id=1'
```

#### `name`
> _Optional String_\
Allows you to filter records by name
```bash
curl -X GET 'http://countries-sundries-api.com/region/all?name=America'
```
