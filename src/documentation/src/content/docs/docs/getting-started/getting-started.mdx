This section will briefly detail some of the endpoints that [Countries Sundries]() generally allows.

At Countries Sundries we have three types of endpoints available:
+ `all`: Returns the records of the requested resource with a maximum of 30 elements!
+ `details`: Returns a single record of the requested resource, with the aim of obtaining an even faster response!
+ `image`: Returns the flag or coat of arm of countries and international organizations!

These are the initial endpoints that Countries Sundries offers you!

In order to make any request, first of all remember that you need access!
To do this, first visit the [Get Access API Key](/docs/introduction/get-api-key) section.

Also, remember to have your Global Header Parameters updated so you can make requests successfully once you have your API key.\
To see if you have them updated, [click here](/docs/api-reference/global-header-parameters)!

## Contents with `all` endpoints available

Initially we have `/all`, in many of the endpont formats it is available to request all the available information, this endpoint allows different parameters that are mostly repeated between the different information contents.\
In all endpoints ending in `all` the [Global Query Parameters]() are present and available for use.
The [Global Query Parameters](), in summary, serve to specify a limited number of records that we will want to bring, to filter by different fields or specify the order of the records.

>The resources with the `details` endpoint enabled are:
>+ Country (to see more, [click here](/docs/api-docs/country))
>+ Coat Of Arm (to see more, [click here](/docs/api-docs/coat-of-arm))
>+ Flag (to see more, [click here](/docs/api-docs/flag))
>+ Currency (to see more, [click here](/docs/api-docs/currency))
>+ Region (to see more, [click here](/docs/api-docs/region))
>+ Subregion (to see more, [click here](/docs/api-docs/sub-region))

## Contents with `details` endpoints available

The `details` endpoint is available in many of the endpont formats, it is available to request a single record of the requested resource, with the aim of obtaining an even faster response!\
In addition to 'all' we have the availability of the `details` endpoint, in which the advantage lies in obtaining a single resource, with this there is a clear improvement in terms of response time with the information.\
Also, the only difference in terms of setting up the fetch is that you must replace `all` with `details` and you will obtain the information of the requested country or organization, in addition to the fact that the response will be faster.

## Basic Usage
>As a presentation, we will make an example of a possible API request that could occur in case you want to bring all possible countries.\
In this example, we are creating an asynchronous arrow function that will search for the URL [**Country Sundries**](http://countries-sundries-api.com/) with the endpoint `country/all`.\
We will use an arrow function that will bring in the **Countries Sundries** URL with the endpoint `country/all`, using the **'GET'** method and with the headers set, which will be `x-countries_sundries_api -key` , `x-api-version`, and we will include an optional header that will be `Content-Type` to bring the data in JSON format.\
We will save the result in a constant and return it, this result will be saved in a constant called _'fetchApiExample'_ and then we will call it.

### Example Request
<CodeExampleGettingStartedAll />

### Header Parameters
:::note[Remember!]
See the [Global Header Parameters](/docs/api-reference/global-header-parameters) section so you can make these requests correctly and with the necessary permissions.
:::

### Response
The response from the server (except for the `image` endpoint) will be given in an array of objects. This will allow for clearer and simplified organization of information.
For this example we will show a part of the endpoint's full response (to see the full response, [click here](/docs/api-docs/country)!)
